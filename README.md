# FTS Grunt

Fresh Tilled Soil's default grunt config.


## Getting Started

Copy the Gruntfile.js and package.json into your project's root directory. Our task runner is optimized to work with the sort of file structure illustrated in our [FTS Static Site Starter Template](https://github.com/freshtilledsoil/FTS-static-site-template).

Next run ```npm install``` or ```sudo npm install``` to get everything setup.


## Commands

```
// Run all tasks
$ grunt

// Watch for changes
$ grunt watch

// Setup local host & watch for changes
$ grunt dev
```
